# Chef and Gym
## Problem
Chef has decided to join a Gym in ChefLand and if possible, also hire a personal trainer at the gym. The monthly cost of the gym is X and personal training will cost him an additional Y per month. Chef's total budget per month is only Z. Print 1 if Chef can only join the gym, 2 if he can also have a personal trainer, and 0 if he can't even join the gym.

Note that if Chef wants to hire a personal trainer, he must join the gym â€” he cannot hire the trainer without joining the gym.

## Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line of input containing three space-separated integers X,Y,Z.
## Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line 2 if Chef can go to the gym and have a trainer, 1 if Chef can only go to the gym, 0 if he can't even go to the gym.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
	    int gym,trainer,budget;
	    cin>>gym>>trainer>>budget;
	    if(budget >= gym+trainer)
	    {
	        cout<<2<<endl;
	    }
	    else if(budget < gym+trainer && budget >= gym)
	    {
	        cout<<1<<endl;
	    }
	    else
	    {
	        cout<<0<<endl;
	    }
	}
	return 0;
}
