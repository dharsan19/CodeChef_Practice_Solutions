# Email Reminders
## Problem
MoEngage helps the Chef send email reminders about rated contests to the participants.

There are a total of NN participants on Chefâ€™s platform, and UU of them have told Chef not to send emails to them.

If so, how many participants should MoEngage send the contest emails to?

## Input Format
The first and only line of input will contain a single line containing two space-separated integers NN (the total number of users) and UU (the number of users who don't want to receive contest reminders).
## Output Format
Output in a single line, the number of users MoEngage has to send an email to.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int n,u;
	cin>>n>>u;
	cout<<n-u<<endl;
	return 0;
}

```
