# MATH1 Enrolment
## Problem
For the upcoming semester, the admins of your university decided to keep a total of XX seats for the MATH-1 course. A student interest survey was conducted by the admins and it was found that YY students were interested in taking up the MATH-1 course.

Find the minimum number of extra seats that the admins need to add into the MATH-1 course to make sure that every student who is interested in taking the course would be able to do so.

## Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two-space separated integers on a single line, XX and YY â€” the current number of seats up for enrolment and the number of students interested in taking up the course in the upcoming semester, respectively.
## Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of seats required to be added.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
	    int x,y;
	    cin>>x>>y;
	    if(x<y)
	    {
	        cout<<y-x<<endl;
	    }
	    else
	    {
	        cout<<0<<endl;
	    }
	}
	return 0;
}
```
