# Tax in Chefland
## Problem
In Chefland, a tax of rupees 1010 is deducted if the total income is strictly greater than rupees 100100.

Given that total income is XX rupees, find out how much money you get.

## Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer XX â€” your total income.
## Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the amount of money you get.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
	    int x;
	    cin>>x;
	    if(x>100)
	        cout<<x-10<<endl;
	    else
	        cout<<x<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
```
