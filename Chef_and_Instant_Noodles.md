# Chef and Instant Noodles
## Problem
Chef has invented 1-minute Instant Noodles. As the name suggests, each packet takes exactly 1 minute to cook.

Chef's restaurant has X stoves and only 1 packet can be cooked in a single pan.

How many customers can Chef serve in Y minutes if each customer orders exactly 1 packet of noodles?

## Input Format
The first and only line of input contains two space-separated integers X and Y â€” the number of stoves and the number of minutes, respectively.
## Output Format
Print a single integer, the maximum number of customers Chef can serve in Y minutes

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int x,y;
	cin>>x>>y;
	cout<<x*y;
	return 0;
}

```
